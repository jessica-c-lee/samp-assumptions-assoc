NSW13 To Do
====================================================================
- Sampling instructions
- Cover story (pics, wording)
- Change timing for instructions screens
- Centre everything like welcome.js, relative to window width??
- Make stimulus appear first, and then questions/ratings etc. (training and test)
- Sampling manipulation: record position of marked cards, record position of selected cards

Leave until the end:
- Change text of welcome.js
- Correct PIS linked
- Working on Mac/PC




CHECK DURING PILOTING
====================================================================
- Recording data okay
- Recording movement away from experiment (using jspsych)



Loop, stuck in dragging until 1/2 cards dragged to top
Look up "Get last click" in javascript
Function executes when button is clicked, callback, look at coordinates
Could make stimuli buttons in grid
VSL grid - outputs strings (grid_stimulus)
	- choices: string as image???
